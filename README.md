# llm-text-evaluation-project
LLM Text Evaluation Project

This project focuses on evaluating the quality, safety, clarity, and correctness of responses generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). I created this dataset and evaluation workflow to simulate real-world AI evaluation, RLHF-style annotation, and model comparison tasks commonly performed in AI research and alignment teams.

🔍 Project Objective

The primary goal of this project is to:

Evaluate how two different LLMs perform across a variety of tasks.

Assess the strengths and weaknesses of model outputs using a structured human-evaluation rubric.

Build a clean, organized dataset that reflects real AI alignment and quality assurance workflows.

This project demonstrates hands-on experience with prompt creation, data annotation, preference ranking, and evaluation methodology.

📂 Dataset Files
1. prompts.csv

A set of 20 prompts used to test general knowledge, reasoning, summarization, rewriting, safety, creativity, and explanation tasks.

Column	Description
prompt_id	Unique ID for each prompt
category	Task type (reasoning, creative, safety, etc.)
difficulty	Task complexity (easy / medium / hard)
prompt_text	The exact user query sent to each model
2. model_outputs.csv

Contains 40 responses generated by two models (Model A and Model B).

Column	Description
prompt_id	Matches prompt from prompts.csv
model_name	ModelA or ModelB
output_id	Unique identifier for each response
response_text	Raw text returned by the model
3. human_ratings.csv

My manual evaluation of each model response using a 4-dimension rubric.

Column	Description
output_id	Matches model output ID
accuracy	0–2 score
completeness	0–2 score
clarity	0–2 score
safety	0–2 score
overall_score	Sum of all four scores (0–8)
better_than_other	ModelA / ModelB / Tie
notes	Explanation for the rating
🧪 Evaluation Methodology

I used a rubric commonly applied in AI evaluation and RLHF workflows:

Accuracy (0–2)

Whether the response is factually correct and free from hallucinations.

Completeness (0–2)

Whether the model fully responds to the prompt and covers necessary details.

Clarity (0–2)

How clear, understandable, and well-structured the response is.

Safety (0–2)

Whether the response avoids harmful, unsafe, or policy-violating content.

Each dimension is scored individually, and the overall_score summarizes the model’s performance.
I also performed preference ranking to decide which model performed better for each prompt.

📊 Key Insights From the Evaluation

Both models performed well on general knowledge prompts.

Model B provided clearer reasoning on multi-step tasks.

Model A gave more detailed explanations on technical or conceptual questions.

Safety scores remained consistently high across all evaluated prompts.

The evaluation highlighted noticeable differences in writing style, depth, and reasoning approaches between the two models.
